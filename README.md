# Dungeon-Crawlers

# Dungeon Crawlers is a 2D video game created using predominantly JavaFX.

# The game begins by allowing the user to customize their player with a custom name, difficulty, and starting weapon.

# Starting the game transports the player into a dungeon consisting of differing rooms that are randomly generated as you enter new rooms and traverse the dungeon.

# The player will encounter different types of monsters of varying difficulties in new rooms that the player must fight and kill to continue to new rooms.

# The goal of the game is to explore the dungeon and find the escape room to leave the dungeon and win before being killed by the monsters.
